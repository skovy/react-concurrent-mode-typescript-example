# React Concurrent Mode TypeScript Example

This is an example [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)
project with TypeScript. Additionally, it enables the experimental concurrent
mode and suspense features and includes the proper experimental types. The
intent is that you can explore and experiment with the new experimental features
but with the type-safety and guardrails of TypeScript.
